# NewZapp
 News app which can be used to access quick daily global news.
 The api used is developer mode so it works only on localhost(CORS enabled for localhost)...so no links are available...sorry for your inconvenience if you wanted to see how it worked.
 You can run this repository in your localhost for it to work.


NO LINKS OF ACTUAL WORKING SITE IS AVAILABLE BECAUSE CORS ENABLED FOR LOCALHOST ONLY BY THE API SITE.
